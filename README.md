# Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with IEMOCAP Dataset

This repository explores sentiment/emotion analysis using multimodal data (audio, video, and text) from the [IEMOCAP dataset](https://sail.usc.edu/iemocap/). We implement and evaluate unimodal and multimodal models to understand the role of full video input and multimodal fusion in emotion recognition.
